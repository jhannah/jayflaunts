On February 25 2024, Aaron Bushnell set himself on fire at the gate of the
Israeli embassy in Washington, DC "as an act of protest against the ongoing
genocide of Palestinians in Gaza."

Aaron wrote "I view enforced homelessness as a societal failing and a crime against humanity."

Chris asked "we enforce homelessness?" Jay tries to convince Chris that we do.

Excerpt from that article: "I've always been bothered by the reality of
homelessness, even back when I was growing up in a conservative community. I
have come to believe in the importance of solidarity politics and I view the
enforcement of homelessness as a major front in the class war which must be
challenged for all our sakes. I view helping my houseless neighbors as a moral
obligation, a matter of social justice, and a matter of good politics. If I
donâ€™t stand with those more marginalized than me today then who will be left to
stand with me tomorrow.

I view enforced homelessness as a societal failing and a crime against
humanity. I believe that no one deserves to be deprived of basic human
necessities. I believe that homelessness as an involuntary condition must be
abolished."

We can talk about anything you want as Jay Flaunce is ignorant. Welcome to Jay
Flaunce's Ignorance, episode 44, Enforced Homelessness with Chris Hoover. If
you'd like to leave a message for the show, call our voicemail line at
1-402-577-0117. Thanks. 
And I believe you said we enforce homelessness, question mark. Is that what you said?
Yeah. So, so that's the question to me. Okay. So do we enforce homelessness?
Okay. So here's how I see the structure of our capitalist system in America
right now. And hopefully my dog isn't doing bad things. All right. I think for
a lot of us that have skills that people will pay us to do, there is no
enforcement of homelessness. I can be homeless tomorrow if I want to. I can
sell the house and now I'm homeless, you know. Or I can have a house because I
have spent decades earning enough money that I have enough capital sitting in a
bank that I can have a house. Right. But for people like my friend downtown who
has some mental challenges, a lot of social challenges, I don't think that he
can produce anything in our capitalistic system of value enough that he could
afford, say, rent, let alone a mortgage. Right. So I feel that for certain
individuals in society, like my friend, because he doesn't have what all of us
value in terms of competitive cutthroat democracy or capitalism, he doesn't
have a way to engage with the money system to not be homeless. So he relies on
other people to provide him housing. Right. And to the extent that we do that,
then our society isn't enforcing homelessness, in my opinion, because housing
is a human right that he has access to, to the extent that we put him in
housing. But to the extent that we don't provide him housing, then our society
is enforcing houselessness on him because he doesn't have, in my opinion, the
capacity to compete in capitalism enough to afford to be able to pay someone
else U.S. dollars for rent sufficient to have him not be homeless. And I feel
like that's enforcement of homelessness for certain people. If we provided
universal housing, right, then I would say we don't. But we don't provide
universal housing. And so I would say that we do. So I would say that America
enforces houselessness for some people systematically. Did I answer your
question? Yeah, I suppose so. I think I think where the maybe the disconnect is
there is that force is kind of a weird issue in that context to me. In the
sense that. Like, there's I guess I look at things like there's consequences
for our actions. Right. And. People being allowed to go through a consequence,
a natural consequence is not any is not force, but people to go through
something that is not a forced consequence of their actions is force. And I do
think that there are some people that maybe fall into a category to me that I
do worry about in the sense that they they don't have the ability to make money
enough to pay for a single place to live or a single room. But, you know, I
would. But that's kind of like a consequence, not necessarily force. So. So. I
think that if I guess the way what I'm trying to say is that I would look at it
more like we're not forcing homelessness on them as much as we are just not
forcing other people to buy them a home. Do you see update that's I know that
that's kind of maybe a little bit of semantics there, but no, no, I get your
point. But the. You know, he's he's my friend, but if he walks into my house,
I'm like, what the hell are you doing here? Get the fuck out. Right. Get out or
I'll call the police who will come with guns and force you out of my house.
Right. Because I did not invite you to live in my house. Right. Right. So I'm
enforcing that he gets the hell off of my property and out of my house because
I'm not willing to help him that much. He's not that good a friend. I have lots
of friends that I would let them live with me. He's not one of them. Yeah. So
he leaves and he goes to a park and he tries to sleep in the park and there's a
city ordinance, which says you can't sleep in the park. So then the police show
up and they tear up all his shit and they throw him out of the park because
he's not allowed to sleep in a city park. Right. So he's being forced out of
there. So then he goes down by the river. Well, it turns out the city owns that
chunk of the river and it's not a park, but the city owns it. You're
trespassing. Get the fuck out. And the police show up and in victim, you know,
they push him out again by force. Right. So I think society enforces
houselessness on people who can't afford housing or they give them housing.
Those are the two possible scenarios. And people are getting forced out of
areas where they're trying to be, quote, housed. Right. All the time. You know,
like, I don't know how bad Omaha is with this, but big cities, L.A. or
whatever. They're every day pushing thousands of people around because they're
not allowed to camp here. They're not allowed to pitch a tent there or
wherever. Right. And that's all for us. Right. So, you know, you look
skeptical. I would agree that they're being forced out of an area, but I don't
know if I would directly relate that to being forced into homelessness. And the
only thing I would add, well, two things, I guess, are these legitimate
experiences that have happened to him or are these hypotheticals? No, not to
him. He's been allowed to sleep on the street. He's been allowed to sleep in
the casino. He's been allowed to sleep in an alley. He's been allowed to sleep.
Illegally in several places against the law. Right. And then they catch on and
they bump him out. Right. So but it's not enough. It's a home. Right. All this
shit's in storage. Right. Because he can't have any of it anywhere because it's
all going to get dumpstered the next day if he doesn't move. Right. So it's not
it's not housing. The bus stop across from where his apartment used to be that
he slept in. That's not he can't, you know, set up shop there and eat
breakfast. You know, it's just whether or not the police roll by and kick him
out at 2 a.m. or not. So anyway, I would say our society is enforcing because
he can't earn enough money. Maybe he can. Right. But I'm not aware of any job
that would hire him to pay enough money that would be enough money to pay rent.
Right. Because of some mental stuff he has going on. Right. I don't I don't
think he could functionally run a cash register or anything. So, yeah. And he
sounds like he falls into the boat of people that I'm technically worried
about. You know, like a lot of times we talk about, you know, the gap widening
between the upper and the lower stuff. And people are always like stuck in
these poor states and states is in conditions like, look at all these people
that are making minimum wage or whatever. But and, you know, I can't really
pull the statistics out right now, but my understanding is a very small
percentage of people literally stay in that category throughout their whole
life, like a minimum wage sort of status. It's something like five or seven
percent. I can't remember. Everybody else, you know, moves out of that category
and then they're just kind of backfilled by somebody else. And then those
people move out. And I would say that five or seven percent is a really low
amount. I thought every time I pulled statistics, you told me that you didn't
jive with statistics. No, but it's a terrible argument. What I'm trying to say
is that statistics themselves aren't a valid reason to violate rights. That's
the only point I ever try to make. So does he have a right to sleep? He has a
right to sleep. Yeah. OK. And this is where maybe he doesn't have a right to
sleep on my property. Right. Right. OK. And so doesn't the city need to provide
housing? I don't think somewhere he can sleep. So so I think that there's
probably a reason why you don't want him to stay in your house. Well, I'm
curious what rights you think he has. What rights does he have? And this is
where it's a little gray area because and where I was going with the whole
statistic thing is he sounds like he's the part of the five or seven percent
that's never really going to be able to move out of it because of his mental
state. And I think we've even talked about this before that I don't know what
to do about people that are in the very lowest part of mental capacity within
the country. Oh, I do. We should provide them home. Well, housing and food and
clothing, basic, basic level stuff. Right. And I do think my only concern with
doing something like that is and maybe maybe there's an idea to prevent this,
but I don't like the idea of them just kind of living off of somebody else or
transferring money from people that have earned it to somebody that hasn't.
Now, I think that people can if they want to volunteer to help. Right. But I
think that part of the problem here is that the reason why you don't want them
in your own personal house and somebody else doesn't want to put up a house for
him to stay in, even rent free, is that he probably is not going to take care
or respect any place that he goes and stays in to some degree. Yeah, he needs a
lot of help with his patterns of residence. And that's why it's probably not
beneficial for us like the city to even just leave them out, you know, next to
the river, because if they let anybody and everybody in those states or
conditions do that, then there's going to be needles. There's going to be other
things where people have also have a right to use that public area for public
things without having to worry about a needle going through the bottom of their
foot or anything like that. I mean, there is an advantage of saying you can't
sleep here. And for everyone else. Yeah. For the people that can't sleep there.
Right. And and where I'm going with that is this that I'm what I'm trying to
say is, is that we're not just kicking them out for no reason either. We're not
saying you're poor. We're going to kick you out. We're saying we're going to
kick you out because it's not safe for society as a whole for you to stay here.
Or we think that society is going to suffer if you stay here as a whole. It's
not about them. It's about. Society looking after its own in the same sense
that I would have the responsibility to look out for my own house and the
people in my house and the same thing that you do, too. Right. I mean, if I
would imagine all of that is part of the reason why you wouldn't let them stay
in your own home, which translates over to why the city doesn't let them just
stay randomly at different places. You're saying the government is enforcing
the the. General public interest is what I would say there. Yeah, the public.
OK, so the people that have money are the majority and the majority. They're
what they want is important, and therefore government should make sure that the
people that have money, that their rights are being protected. I don't think
it's about people with money. I think it's about people that are living in a
civil society that don't want to step on syringes or they they want to feel
safe and in fact be safe. You know, like I think that that's what it's more
about. I mean, we're not like quizzing these people and saying, oh, do you have
money? Oh, you don't have money. GTFO, you know, that's not what's happening
here. And I think that that's generally the case with homeless people there.
They're homeless for a reason. And those reasons are incompatible with a safe
and functioning society in general. And therefore, that's why they say stay
out. So so as a city that has millions of dollars to build a new baseball
stadium, why don't we also house these people? I don't think we should build a
baseball stadium. OK, great. So I need to come up with something else that we
wasted money on. Like to me, this is the basic fundamental building blocks upon
which a society should be built. It's taking care of the most needy people.
Some guy named Jesus said this, and I've been preaching it ever since, that
that it's important baseline that people don't starve, have safe drinking water
and somewhere to sleep and a toilet. Like I and I don't understand how we ever
think that we're a good society. When we're not doing that. Yeah. For
everybody. And honestly, I and you know, I should maybe look more into this and
I'll openly admit that I don't care enough about it to really kind of research
it. I don't know what's out there for people that are considered homeless for
Omaha. Like, isn't there a place that they can go? Yeah, there's a whole
network of places. So why doesn't he go to one of those network of places? He
is in one of them now. Yeah. Oh, so he does have a house. I don't think I'd
call it a home and I don't know how long they're going to house him before they
kick him out. Right. Because I don't know much about that. It's in Council
Bluffs. It's a facility I'm not familiar with. I'll learn more about it today
when I go down there. But but I don't know. Right. So is that supportive
housing or is that just an emergency shelter? I don't know. Like the difference
between emergency shelter and supportive housing or is big. That's a big
difference. Big, big gap. Yeah. So my understanding is, too, and I should know
more about this, but I don't. But I thought that there is as a part of the
social air quotes safety net that we have in this country. If you fall below a
certain line of being able to take care of yourself, then you do get financial
support. And it's not it's not nothing. Yeah. Medicaid. Yeah. And I don't know.
I don't know. I'm not a caseworker, but. Right. So they both get checks. Right.
Like him and his partner, they get checks. Right. And and and so I guess I
don't understand how we're enforcing homelessness if we're providing an
emergency place to stay. And we also provide him with checks where he could
actually pay for a place. But it's not enough money to pay for a place. But it
is if he wanted to share with somebody, though. Right. So and that's another
thing is that we kind of so. Yeah. And I don't I didn't I didn't mean to imply
that we've that we meaning tax dollars, the tax base has never given him
anything. That is absolutely not true. This guy has spent way more tax money
than I have. I mean, he had heart surgery and shit. Right. I've never had heart
surgery. That's expensive. So I've put in a lot more money into the system and
he's taken a lot more money out of the system than I have personally because of
his medical things. Now I'm getting older and my medical things will start
racking up any to any day now. So my private insurance covers so much based on
all my payments, based on my salary, based on the work I do, blah, blah, blah.
But, you know. So, yeah. So and I do think that there are some things that we
could to do as a society to employ people like him. I would assume he can pick
up trash off the street. Yeah. Yeah. If he had supervision, he could probably
get a lot of that done. So, yeah. Well, sort of like he had a toe amputated so
he can get along. His mobility is pretty good. I don't know that he could pull
like eight hour shifts on his feet. I'm not sure that's feasible, but maybe. It
sounds to me like he probably needs to pull eight hours on his feet at least.
And what I'm saying is he probably lost his big toe because he's probably not
taking care of himself and probably not moving around enough. And I'm not a
doctor. I don't know his situation, but I know that that's a common thing. I
don't know his situation, but I know that that's a common area for that. You
know what I'm saying? So and this is what. But that doesn't change the fact
that he might not be able to pick up trash off the street 40 hours a week. I
don't know. I don't know. I'm not a doctor. I don't have his medical history.
The way I look at it is that somebody in a wheelchair should be able to do pick
up trash off the side of the road. They at least try. They may not be the most
productive at it, but that's not what we're looking for. Right. And the reason
why I'm bringing. So like some of the people I know in wheelchairs are pretty,
pretty mobile. And then some are very not mobile. Yeah. And I'm not I'm not
saying like someone that's a quadriplegic should be. Some of them I think could
pick up trash. Yeah. I think some of them could not. So and this is I think
that work itself is therapeutic. I think that work benefits society. So I can't
remember me and Kelly were driving somewhere yesterday. We were going downtown.
I can't remember

exactly where we were at, but I looked over to the right, oh, it was actually,
it wasn't even downtown. We were going to the Walmart on Highway 133, and we
were looking at the side of the road, and there was bags of trash everywhere.
And it doesn't take a very highly skilled person to pick that up. And what I'm
trying to say is that even if you take his Medicaid, he's still allowed to earn
a specific, some amount of money, right? And I think that if we want to employ
people like him, I think that there are opportunities to employ him. I'm not
saying that he should make a certain minimum wage there or anything like that,
but I do think that we could pay people in his situation to work eight hours a
day to supplement what he already gets for Medicaid. I think that people that
are in his position should be able to split the rent with other people, but
there's also risks associated with that. People that don't want to necessarily
rent the house to him because he's not going to take care of it. You know, he's
going to destroy it. I mean, there's a basic level of needing to interact with
society that's also owed to society, right? I can't say that everybody owes him
everything, and he owes nothing in return, but I cannot come to that
conclusion. And that's where I go to, he does not have housing as a right. It
is an interaction. Housing is an interaction, and he owes his own
responsibility for that, even if it is just treating that stuff with respect.
So today I get in my truck, I get in a huge car wreck, and now I'm barely
cognizant of anything at all. Does society owe me housing? I can't. There's no
way I can work. I can barely communicate. Those are complicated questions to
work through, and, you know, I've talked to Kelly about it. Oh, here's the
answer. Yes, society should make sure that that person is housed. I saved you
the trouble. Congratulations. You have the answer now. It's not complicated. So
you're saying your parents wouldn't house you? Oh, me? Yeah. Oh, sorry. In your
specific case? I thought that's kind of what you- I'm fine. I'd be fine. I
have, like, my career is fine. I have short-term and long-term disability
insurance that I've been paying for for 15 years, you know? So if I'm
completely disabled, I get 60% of my salary as if I'm working forever until I'm
dead, right? My insurance is awesome, assuming it works, right? Assuming they
actually pay out and don't somehow dodge the fact that I've been paying all
these premiums for short- and long-term disability for all these decades. So
I'd be fine, and I don't think the taxpayer would have to do anything for me.
It would be the private insurance companies that I've sent all this money to
that would now suddenly be paying out the nose to keep me in food, clothing,
shelter. Right. And those things are- For no work. Like, I'm contributing
nothing to society. But those things are kind of about the reduction of risk in
and of itself, right? Yeah. They're playing a game, right? So there's a million
people. They have a million, you know? And they're just mathematically, okay,
this is going to happen 15 times. And so we're going to pull money out of
900,000 people, and 15 times we're going to pay out these huge multi-million
dollar, yeah. But that's not the only way- Then they're making money. That's
not the only way that they're reducing risk either, though, right? So like, it
is affecting your behavior. So for example, you probably understand that if you
get into your same car, and you are going to run through a parade, and while
you're running through a parade, you accidentally hit something, and then you
become disabled, you're probably not going to get those benefits anymore.
Right. Because you intentionally caused an accident in which you were involved.
Or if you went out drunk driving. All these other things contribute to the
reduction of risk, not only just for yourself, but for society as a whole. And
that's how those things benefit society as a whole. And that's what I'm trying
to get at here, is that it's not about just money or rights. It's about how
society interacts with itself in somewhat of a self-regulating, self-governing
way. And just giving somebody a house, thinking that you've solved a problem, I
fail to see how for your friend, that would do just that. No, you couldn't do
that. He'd destroy it. And that's another problem. No, what he needs, as far as
I can tell, and maybe I'm just a sucker, maybe he's conning me, I don't know.
But I've worked with him for years. What he needs is supportive housing, in
that someone is keeping an eye on his day-to-day living, once a day or
whatever. Somebody's checking in for a half hour a day, just to make sure that
he has the basic human sanitary conditions under control. In terms of dishes,
you have to wash them and put them away. That kind of stuff. Right. And how
does he personally get motivated to do that on his own? Just because you have
somebody standing over him, monitoring him, doesn't necessarily mean that he
will do that, or that we can get him to do that. If he has the capacity to do
it, and he refuses to do it, then I think, yeah, there should be consequences
for that. Should he be homeless? So let's say you have your situation, they
say, yeah, you do this, he doesn't do it. Yeah, here's what I want. And you're
being so stingy with your tax dollars. What I want is supportive housing, and
take it as part of his SSI, or whatever, whatever. He's got housing, and he's
got somebody that's checking in on him every day. And they try to work with
him. They're like, hey, look, you're going to get cockroaches. You can't do
this. You have to do this. He has the mental capacity to do that. He
understands. He works a lot of systems. He can figure out the bus. Thank God he
figured out the bus. I was really hesitant that he wouldn't be able to figure
out the bus thing, but apparently he does. And now he can use the crap out of
his... Lots of bus stuff. Great. Because that's not the simplest thing in the
world, the bus network trying to plan your schedule and everything. Anyway,
yeah, if you had someone in there and working with him, and these are the
basics of, hey, here's how we do laundry, and showing him how to do it, I think
he could do it. If he's choosing not to do it, he can do it, and he's choosing
not to do it, then I'm like, oh, okay, well, we tried to give you the safety
net, and you totally could have fixed it, and you didn't, and now you're out of
the net, and you're homeless. And I'd feel way better about that, because I'd
be like, oh, well, we tried really hard to give him a system where he can
totally choose to cooperate with that system and have what he needs, and he's
chosen not to, and therefore, dah, dah, dah. That I'm fine. Right. And just to
bring us to common ground, I'm actually, I agree with that statement 100%. The
only thing I would add is that I feel like he's already been given that
opportunity. Now, we could disagree on that, I'm sure, but the fact that he's
homeless is because he can't, and especially in today's society where he has
Medicare, Medicaid, whatever, maybe the only thing that I would add is to give
him supplemental opportunities that's organized by the government that says,
hey, we have this task that needs to be done from a city standpoint. We need to
clean up all these needles off of the river that your buddy's brought over
here, and we've been kicking them out, and we got all this other stuff. We
could pay him on an hourly basis to clean up, and it doesn't even have to be
that. I'm sure that there's other tasks that don't require a high level of
intelligence that can be done, and we could pay him to do those tasks. There's
a cost more, but it's possible that's a good thing to do, regardless of whether
or not we lose money on it as a society, right? It's possible. I'm not sure if
I have to employ a bunch of people who are going to manage the people that I'm
employing, is that worth it? I understand work programs. Work programs for the
sake of giving people a job, I get that. That's fine. But I don't think from a
tax dollar perspective, I don't know that those are productive in terms of
actually producing goods or something that can be sold, compared to how much
labor you had to put into it to get that out. But I don't know. I don't know
either. I don't know if you're ... Are you making a point that, hey, we could
be saving money by putting these people to work, or are you making the point
that work is good and we should offer job opportunities to people because work
is good? The second one, for sure. I don't know if we'd save money, but ... So
even if it costs more, putting them in a work program would be a good thing to
do, possibly. So what are those things that drive around and pick up trash on
the street, like they got the little sweepers on them? Street sweeper? I guess
maybe that's what they're called. Street sweeper, yeah. So I think the idea of
a street sweeper, air quote, saves money, because we wouldn't have to pay a lot
of people to do something that a mechanized vehicle could do more and better
job at, right? I mean, it gets the pebbles up, gets the sand up, probably gets
the salt up. So I'm not saying that we save money by hiring these people to do
a task that, to some degree, a street sweeper would do better and cheaper at,
and cover more ground. What I am saying is that we could pay them to do
something that does need to be done, and therefore society would be benefiting
from what we're paying. It may not be the best option to achieve the given
task, but it is something that's available now, and we could pay them to do
that task, and society would get something out of it. Could we make it more
efficient by doing different things or hiring different people? Sure, we could.
But what I'm saying is that it is something that is, in fact, needs to be done,
and it is work. And since it does need to be done and it is work, it gives them
the feeling of being able to accomplish a task and participating in society in
a way that benefits both of them. They get paid, society gets the trash cleaned
up. And it doesn't even have to be those tasks, but just that concept that
people get the benefit of the reward of payment to complete a task that needs
to be done, and that's how we kind of interact and start to interact with
society in meaningful ways. I think it's great. I think you're proposing a job
program. Yeah. And I'm like, great. Yeah. Let's do that. And I don't know why
we don't. But I think we do. I don't know. I don't know anything about job
programs. Well, it's interesting if we do that. And I mean, everywhere I turn,
there's just â€“ the streets are just littered. So I don't know if there's just a
lack of interest for people to do something like that for extra money, you
know? Even myself, if I'm just sitting around not doing anything all day, every
day of the week, 365 days a year, I'm probably going to be doing stuff I
shouldn't be doing. I feel like it gives people purpose. I think it gives
people a way to participate in society. And they understand, too, that, hey,
wait a minute, I'm cleaning up this trash and some of it's mine. I can see the
cost that I pose on society because I'm not doing my part to take care of
things and keep things â€“ you know, like, it just â€“ it's a universal way. You
know, in a lot of debates and things, I see people talking about, well, this is
part of a system of exploitation. We'd be exploiting them to get them out there
to pick up the trash. And I just don't see that in standard voluntary
transactions that people do for everyday work. Well, it could be exploitative,
for sure. Like, it needs to be run well, otherwise it is exploitative, in my
opinion. But anyway, yeah, the only job program I think I'm at all familiar
with is Heart Ministries. So they do a lot of food distribution, and part of
that is that they've got a bunch of warehouse workers that are doing a bunch of
stuff. And some of that, I think, is post-incarceral workers, like people who
are coming out of prison and need some kind of halfway house kind of employment
situation. And they do a bunch of that. And then, like, I think they do, like,
you know, troubled teens, young adults, right, that are whatever, bumping into
problems or whatever. And they do that, right? So it's job training as far as,
like, how do warehouses work, and how does inventory control work, and how do
we, you know, move all this crap around work, and how does the trucking work,
and the receiving, and the scheduling, and the shipping, and the entry, you
know, all this stuff. There's a ton of stuff you can't learn, right? And that's
part, I think, of their whole program. I'd have to look up the website, but
yeah, Heart Ministries in Omaha, I'm vaguely familiar with that. You pulled up
their website, nice. So it does look like that's what you're talking about. So
I don't know how much society is doing that versus how much independent
individual donor philanthropists are making that fiscally possible, you know?
So I don't know if they've got a grant, you know, for $8 million from whoever
rich person, or if they have a bunch of, if they're constantly filling out,
what are the grant proposals for government money? I don't know, right? So to
the extent that my tax dollars are going to support Heart Ministries, I assume
that's a good thing, right? And I have no reason to believe it's not a good
thing, but I could imagine exploitive situation where they're getting free
labor to run their for-profit business, right? Paying them jack shit, that's
not fair. That wouldn't be cool. I'm not talking about Heart Ministries. I'm
talking about there could be problems with not paying people living wages to do
things, and minimum wages and living wage. So congratulations. Yeah. Yeah. And
I would honestly agree with that. I don't even know if we've talked about any
of those instances where I do think that there is some exploitive things that
do happen in our society, but that, I mean, I think that there is something to
be said that I think that that exploitation in that sense should be a legal
issue, not a job opportunity issue, and not like an opinion thing, but
something that could be based on some objective facts. Yeah. I think exploiting
workers hopefully is illegal, right? Yeah. Hopefully they're violating the law
by exploiting labor. And I can get behind that. Yeah. Cool. Okay. Well, my
whole other topic was, was a week and a half ago, we were talking about
monopolies and monopolistic practices, and I was like, oh, I've got a whole
bunch of stuff on that, but this recording is probably too long already. So
should we do a separate episode? How long have we been going? 35 minutes. It
looks like. Oh, that's it? I think so. Oh, okay. Can I pull this off? Can I
switch gears? Well, maybe we can just start talking about it anyways, but is
that a Discord conversation as well? My recollection was we were trying to
lightly exercise your dog's leg in your backyard. Oh, yeah. And I said
something that I was talking about from Discord and you said something and then
I said something and I, uh, yeah, I don't think I can pull this off right now.
What time is it when I get a load of the truck? Oh, it's 11. Okay. Um, yeah, I
don't think, I think we'll have to, I think we'll have to call this one episode
and I'll organize my thoughts for another one. Oh yeah. No, I'm sorry. I was
actually just looking back in the conversations on Discord to see. I'm proud of
Huey. Huey did good. I mean, one thing, but. Oh, that's pretty normal. After
one thing, he settled down. Well, one reason why I did want to pick up stuff
that they could fight over is that Missy's not innocent with that stuff either.
Yeah. You know what I'm saying? So it's not like all of that was his fault. I
don't think we can put all of that on Huey. No, I'm just, I'm worried he
outweighs her by a factor of five. So I'm more worried that he's going to
damage her than the other way around. Oh yeah. Well, I mean, certainly that he
could get ahold of her. Missy could. Missy's hurt. She bit through my skin to
where I could see bone before. Did I ever tell you that? God. Well, I don't
think it was her fault either. I mean, yes, it was her tooth, but. So like we
used to use those Martingale collars. Do you remember when we used to use
those? When it has the edge. Do you still use them? Yeah. Well, one time her
and Alex were fighting and not fighting. I think they were legitimately
playing. Well, Alex got his bottom jaw caught in her loop on her Martingale
collar. Oh no. And they were freaking out. And I reached in to get Alex out of
her Martingale collar. And I think she bit me not knowing what like what's
going on. And she bit me like through my knuckle right here to where I could
see my bone in my knuckles. I just let it heal. I probably should have went to
the doctor, but at any rate, I mean, she's a. I mean, she's got a strong. Yeah.
I didn't know your knuckles without stitches. I didn't think your knuckle skin
would if you had a big puncture, but it wasn't really big. It was probably
maybe like an eighth of an inch hole, but you could still see through the skin
and into everything that was there. That was a good time, is he? Yeah. I
wouldn't hold that against Huey if that happened. Yeah. I mean, I'm just
worried that when, when he gets, you know, oh, he is a big dog. He's big. Yeah.
Anyways. Yeah. We might have to come back to the monopoly thing. I can't even
find it in discord to kind of figure out and I'm not remembering off the top of
my head. I've filled it with this current conversation. I can't remember off
the top of my head what I thought I could talk about for half an hour on that.
All right. Well, anything else going on or should we call it for this? Oh, we
can call it unless you've got something else you want to talk about. I don't
think so. All right. Thanks. Thanks, Chris. Thank you. Another episode in the
can. Look at what we did. Yeah. It's a good mess. Good girl. Again, that
voicemail number is 1-402-577-0117 if you'd like to leave us a message. Thanks.
