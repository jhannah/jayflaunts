Chris and Jay experiment with a new format: 2 lapel mics in the backyard while
running 4 dogs around. Jay asks a question from the excellent 80,000 hours podcast:
<a href="https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/andreas-mogensen-deontology-and-effective-altruism/">Andreas
Mogensen on whether effective altruism is just for consequentialists</a>.

billions, trillions of people?
