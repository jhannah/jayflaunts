In this very silly and pointless episode four of us play the
[Total Rickall Card Game](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/194232/rick-and-morty-total-rickall-card-game).
We enthusiastically recommend that game and 
[Rick and Morty S2E4](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4832262/?ref_=ttep_ep4), from which it came.

In the intro Brad explains why posting this episode at all is pointless. 
And why the Nintendo Switch Zelda: Breath of the Wild stamina bar is total BS.

Who knows why anyone enjoys anything on the Internet? Mysteries abound. The Dude abides.
