On February 3, 2023, about 8:54 p.m. local time, eastbound Norfolk Southern Railway (NS) general
merchandise freight train 32N derailed 38 railcars on main track 1 of the NS Fort Wayne Line of
the Keystone Division in East Palestine, Ohio.

Jay and Chris talk about safety in the rail industry.

Special note: Our friend Frank Tabor, from episode 13, passed away in the last month. We miss him.
We find comfort in listening to his voice as recorded back in 2015.
