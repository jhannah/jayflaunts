[Anarcho-capitalism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-capitalism)
(also referred to as free-market anarchism, market anarchism, private-property anarchism, libertarian anarchism) is a political philosophy which advocates the elimination of the state in favor of individual sovereignty, private property, and open markets.

... eliminate the state? Wha??

What's the point of government? What's it good at? Bad at?
Is democracy all it's cracked up to be?

Join Alec and Jay for a fascinating exploration of alternative governance. Or lack thereof. :)
