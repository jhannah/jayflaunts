Jay and Alex talk about crypto currencies, ADA specifically, proof of stake vs.
proof of work, the NASEC staking pool that Alex runs from England, how crypto
can and should work to help people in developing countries, etc.

Please delegate your ADA to NASEC! Jay recommends the [Yoroi wallet](https://yoroi-wallet.com/)
which is super lightweight, fast, and easy for delegation. It costs you nothing, your ADA
is not locked, you can move it anytime.
