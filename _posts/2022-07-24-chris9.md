Chris and Jay talk about growing up with your dad as a small town police officer
and how Chris joined the Army in response to 9/11. Chris talks about his years in
Afghanistan, how he saw the US Army as mostly a pacifist organization. The good they
tried to do in country and why our efforts, apparently, largely failed.
