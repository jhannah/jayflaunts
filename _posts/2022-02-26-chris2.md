The first hour Chris and Jay revisit the ethics of wealth disparities. Jay tries to
find common ground, and finally does, with a "100 people on the moon" hypothetical.
We probably need to revisit again. :)

The second hour switches to affirmative action discussions. Jay was entirely
unprepared, promises to launch a spirited debate next episode.

  Jay is wrong. And Jay feels very uncomfortable disagreeing with an African American on this topic. :)
  According to Walter, affirmative action has been doing more harm than good since 1965.
