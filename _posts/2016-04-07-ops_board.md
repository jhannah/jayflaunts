Alex P. Gates is running for Omaha Public Schools (OPS) Board of Directors
in Distict 3. He'd appreciate your vote this November. 
We talk about his motivations to run, how OPS works, and how to improve it.
Also, how PTAs/PTOs work, last October's sex ed public 
meeting that turned ugly, and student population forecasting 
frustrations.

Beyond school stuff, we also chatted about the Keystone XL pipeline,
Open/Nebraska, and Jay's imminent hobo lifestyle.
