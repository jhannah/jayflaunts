Pokèmon Go didn't exist a week ago, and is suddenly the #1 app in the world.
Jay talks with Gabriel Fitzgarrald, a lifetime Pokèmon super fan 
about its Ingress heritage, its amazing impact on millions of people
young and old suddenly getting tons of exercise, and game and social dynamics.

Did you know the Westboro Baptist Church is a Pokèmon Go gym? No kidding. Yowzers.
