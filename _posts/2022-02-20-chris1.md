The first half hour, Chris and I talk about our high level "left vs. right" politics, and if those
labels actually mean anything when reasonable people actually talk to each other.
We touch on various charity experiences we've had, and the personal responsibility people need to
have for themselves. 

At 30-40m we talk about the Future of Work and what a healthy society looks like
if a huge percentage of humans are unemployable due to automation.

At 50m we abruptly pivot to gun legislation including so called "Duty to Retreat"
and "Stand Your Ground" laws.
