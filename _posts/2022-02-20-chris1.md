If you're not familiar with Bitcoin and Cardano, listen to episode 28 first.

Jay and Alex talk about last week's launch of SundaeSwap on the Cardano network and how
it's impacted the entire Cardano ecosystem. For good and ill. SundaeSwap is a DEX (decentralized
exchange) whose popularity has caused impressive backlogs (wait times) for the entire network.

To support Alex please delegate your ADA to [NASEC](https://nasec.co.uk/cardano/)!
Jay recommends the [ccvault.io](https://ccvault.io/)
wallet which is super lightweight, fast, and easy for delegation. It costs you nothing, your ADA
is not locked, you can move it anytime.

If charity pools are your thing, please delegate your ADA to [BIO](https://pool.bio/).

For stronger security Jay recommends using
[Billfodl + Ledger Nano X](https://privacypros.io/products/ledger-nano-x-billfodl/)
hardware wallet.
