[Anarcho-capitalism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-capitalism)
(also referred to as free-market anarchism, market anarchism, private-property anarchism, libertarian anarchism) is a political philosophy which advocates the elimination of the state in favor of individual sovereignty, private property, and open markets.

... eliminate the state? Wha??

Join Alec and Jay for a fascinating exploration of alternative governance. Or lack thereof. :)
