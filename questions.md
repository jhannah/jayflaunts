Flushing out questions / notes in advance of interviews. 


# <a name="evil"></a>The Problem of Evil

I love the [Drunk Ex-Pastors podcast](http://www.drunkexpastors.com/). 
I'm extremely happy that in episode #30 at 1h 5m Christian gets angry about God sending
people to hell. This outrage was entirely missing from episode #29 at 28m when you listened to 
what Stephen Fry would say to God if he met him. 
[Stephen Fry's angry "how dare you" challenge to God](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-suvkwNYSQo)
is exactly what I would say to God. Did you listen to the autrocities of nature Stephen Fry
listed? Did you think about those? If God exists then it seems to me that 
anger is exactly the correct response to the suffering of millions of innocent people. 

Lucky for me I'm an atheist, so there is no God. So... problem solved. 

Love the podcast. Thanks guys, keep it up. :)



# <a name="fvs"></a>Friedman v. Steel - Nebraska Open Records Case

Bruce Friedman is a 25 year IT veteran, primarily in infrastructure engineering and 
architecture. Also a father of 9, an avid proponent of open records, and a person 
who is patently interested in whatever the data shows, the data shows.

# <a name="prosector_impartiality"></a>Prosecutor Impartiality

Recent news events have left me wondering:
How do prosecutors, who work on the same team with the police all day every day,
stay impartial when the defendant is a police officer?

As a rambunctious teenager I experienced tension with police on two occasions.
In my adult life I've had no trouble at all. 
Police have always been very helpful and professional.
I assume the fact that I'm a boring, law-abiding, stable, middle class white guy
plays at least some role in that history.

I assume law enforcement is a challenging, difficult job that often goes 
under-appreciated. I assume most officers are doing excellent work. 
But inevitably, mistakes will be made. Some of those mistakes will 
result in loss of life. 

When people die during police action are the police subject to the same
prosecution an average citizen is? More? Less? I try to 
imagine being a prosecutor who relies on police every day to do my job. 
Would I not have enormous incentive to make sure I don't alienate the
police force by prosecuting an officer?

How can prosecutors be impartial? Are they? Does the article below offer evidence 
that they're not? Are police being held to a fair standard? Why are grand
jury results so different when the defendent is a police officer? Does that
mean the system is broken?

[Matt Wynn's personal homepage](http://mattwynn.net/) says: My name’s Matt. I’m a web developer and reporter with 
the Omaha World-Herald. I write stories that uncover problems, advocate for the open web and 
build apps that let people make the news their own.

# <a name="on"></a>Open Nebraska

[Open Nebraska](http://opennebraska.io/) is a civic innovation organization serving the 
citizens of the great state of Nebraska. Founded in 2012, our mission is to solve 
community problems through civic application development, open data advocacy, and tech 
education. We aim to drive innovation and community engagement in Nebraska by making 
local information more accessible to the public.

* Why did you create Open Nebraska in 2012?
* What's happening in 2015? 
* Is wrangling legal documents somehow not the most frustrating thing ever? :)
It seems like there are lots of nice people with good intentions doing their individual
jobs in government, but engaging "the system" itself seems so very daunting? 
Can individuals with jobs and families and other interests make a dent over time?
* Do you need more help? What skill sets are you looking for? How can people get involved?
